<h1>OpenCV â€“ Operators</h1>
<h2>Done by : <code>Mohammad Moazam</code></h2>
<h2>Exercise 1 : Local operator</h2>
<p>In this exercise we had to implement operators in our class.
We had to implement the following operators :</p>
<ul>
<li>Operator =</li>
<li>Operator (i,j)
*Operator [index]</li>
</ul>
<p>I was not sure to what to implement in the functions as it was explicitly mentioned in the exercise. So, I used them to implement Mat functions.</p>
<h3><code>virtual void operator=(Mat&amp; src)</code></h3>
<p>I used this operator to make a shallow copy of the given src.</p>
<h3><code>virtual const Mat operator[](const Rect &amp;roi)</code></h3>
<p>I used the [] to get the rect portion from the stored Mat object.</p>
<h3><code>virtual const Vec3b operator()(int i, int j)</code></h3>
<p>I used to () to get the vector at location (i,j). (at(i,j) function of Mat)</p>
