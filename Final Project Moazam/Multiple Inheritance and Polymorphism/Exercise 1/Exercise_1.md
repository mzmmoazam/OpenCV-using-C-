# OpenCV â€“ Multiple Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Done by : `Mohammad Moazam`

## Exercise 1 :  Multiple inheritance and image processing

In this exercise we had to create two classes BlurFiltering and EdgeDetector that inherit from Base and Mat classes.

### ***```Base class```***

This class has some common functions for classes BlurFiltering and EdgeDetector.

* **``parameters``**

  * `int process`

    * this is used to store the process

  * `baseTypes type`

    * baseTypes is enum that has two options EdgeDetect, BlurFilter. This parameter will store type of process (to distinguish between edge detection and bur filtering).

* **``constructors``**

  * `Base(baseTypes _type)`

    * this constructor sets the type of the process

  * `Base(int \_process, baseTypes \_type)`

    * constructor sets the type of the process and the process (enum / integer)

* **``member functions``**

  * `void setOpenCVProcessName(EdgeDetectors _process)`

    * this function will be used to set process for edge detection

  * `void setOpenCVProcessName(BlurFilters _process)`

    * this function will be used to set process for blur filtering

  * `const char* getOpenCVProcessName()`

    * this function will return the current set process
  
### ***```BlurFiltering class```***

This class inherits from Base class and cv::Mat class. This class is used to perform blurfiltering.

* **``parameters``**

  * `const int sigma = 3`

    * const value used in Blur filtering algorithms

  * `const int ksize = (sigma * 5) | 1`

    * const value used in Blur filtering algorithms

* **``constructors``**

  * `BlurFiltering() : Base(BlurFilter) {}`

    * this default constructor sets the type of the process automatically by calling the base constructor

  * `BlurFiltering(const Mat& src, BlurFilters process = MEAN) : Mat(src), Base(process, BlurFilter) {}`

    * constructor initialises the Mat class and the Base class by providing the source Mat and automatically setting the type in Base class.

* **``member functions``**

  * `void compute(Mat& input)`

    * this function is used to run the process (a blur filtering algorithm) on input. I used reference to make it more efficient (space and time both).

  * `void compute()`

    * this function will be used on the Mat data (that we init in constructor) and run the compute on that.

### ***```EdgeDetector class```***

This class inherits from Base class and cv::Mat class. This class is used to perform edge detection.

* **``parameters``**

  * `const int lowThreshold = 50`

    * const value used in edge detection algorithms

  * `const int ratio = 3`

    * const value used in edge detection algorithms

  * `const int kernel_size = 3`

    * const value used in edge detection algorithms

  * `const int scale = 1, delta = 0`

    * const value used in edge detection algorithms

* **``constructors``**

  * `EdgeDetector() : Base(EdgeDetect) {}`

    * this default constructor sets the type of the process automatically by calling the base constructor

  * `EdgeDetector(const Mat& src, EdgeDetectors process = CANNY) : Mat(src), Base(process, EdgeDetect) {}`

    * constructor initialises the Mat class and the Base class by providing the source Mat and automatically setting the type in Base class.

* **``member functions``**

  * `void compute(Mat& input)`

    * this function is used to run the process (a edge detection algorithm) on input. I used reference to make it more efficient (space and time both).

  * `void compute()`

    * this function will be used on the Mat data (that we init in constructor) and run the compute on that.

#### Comments

___

I have seperated the code in a new folder name "psrs" and all the header files can be used by using the _namespace psrs_.

There is main.cpp that runs the `main()` function as per asked in the exercise 1.
