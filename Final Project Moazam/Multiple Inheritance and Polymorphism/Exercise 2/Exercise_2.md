# OpenCV â€“ Multiple Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 2 : Virtual members

In this exercise we had to implement a virtual function `void globalProcess ( base& imageProcessing, const cv::Mat& imageToProcess )`.

I implemented this function by creating a virtual function in Base class.

### comments

I have transferred the function and constants to `psrs/base.h` file.
